Introduction to Networking
==========================

This is my under-development book on introduction to network technology.  

You can view or view the latest version of the book in 
<a href="http://do1.dr-chuck.com/net-intro/EN_us/net-intro.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a>
or
<a href="http://do1.dr-chuck.com/net-intro/EN_us/net-intro.epub" target="_blank">EPUB</a>
(rebuilt hourly)

To produce the PDF of the book, you will need to install LaTeX on your system. For Linux:

    apt-get install texlive-full
    apt-get install pandoc

For Macintosh,

    https://www.tug.org/mactex/
    https://www.tug.org/mactex/mactextras.html
    
    https://pandoc.org/installing.html#macos

To build the book yourself, run

    pandoc --default-image-extension=svg --epub-stylesheet=epub.css *.mkd -o x.epub

    pandoc --default-image-extension=svg *.mkd -o x.html

    pandoc -s -N --toc --default-image-extension=eps -V fontsize:11pt -V documentclass:book --template=template.latex *.mkd -o x.pdf 

Or some similar pandoc command.

You can also run the pdf through LaTeX using 

	sh book.sh

Since the index requires two passes.

You can also generate audio readings of all of the chapters in the audio folder using 

	sh audio.sh

If you are on a Mac.

Spell checking:
